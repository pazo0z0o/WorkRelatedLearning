1) AppDomain Class:
The AppDomain class represents an application domain in .NET. An application domain provides an isolated and controlled environment where applications run. 
It acts as a container that separates and protects different applications or components from each other. Each AppDomain has its own set of loaded assemblies, 
configuration settings, security policies, and memory space. AppDomains allow for the isolation of applications, improved security, and better resource management.

AppContext Class:
The AppContext class provides access to a set of contextual information and services related to the current application's execution environment.
 It allows you to query and modify various application-specific settings and behaviors. 
 The AppContext class provides properties that can be used to check or set the values of specific application contexts,
 such as culture, formatting, or compatibility switches.

2) Differences between AppDomain Class and AppContext Class:
- AppDomain is a fundamental concept in the .NET Framework, while AppContext is a newer addition introduced in .NET Framework 4.6. AppDomains are used to isolate and manage application execution,
 while AppContext provides access to specific application contexts and settings.

- AppDomains provide complete isolation of resources, such as assemblies, security policies, and memory, 
while AppContext operates within the same AppDomain and focuses on modifying specific application behaviors and settings.

- AppDomains are typically used in scenarios where you need to run multiple applications or components within the same process but isolated from each other,
 such as in hosting environments.
 AppContext, on the other hand, is useful when you want to modify certain aspects of the application's behavior or retrieve specific contextual information.

3) Use cases for both:
- AppDomain:
  - Application isolation: Running multiple applications or components within the same process while keeping them separate and independent.
  - Plugin systems: Loading and unloading plugins or extensions dynamically while maintaining separation between them.
  - Sandboxing: Running untrusted code or scripts in a controlled environment to enhance security.

- AppContext:
  - Modifying application behavior: Changing application-specific settings and behaviors based on contextual information, such as culture, formatting, or compatibility switches.
  - Feature toggles: Enabling or disabling specific features or functionality based on runtime conditions or configuration.
  - Migrating legacy applications: Using compatibility switches to adapt older applications to newer frameworks or runtime behaviors without modifying their source code.

Both AppDomain and AppContext provide essential features for managing application execution, isolation, and customization,
but they serve different purposes and cater to different scenarios.
